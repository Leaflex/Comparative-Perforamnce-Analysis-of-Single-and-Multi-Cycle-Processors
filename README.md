# Single-Cycle-Software-Multi-Cycle-Hardware-Multi-Cycle-Processor
Git repo containing documentation and code for Alexander Somers and Remmington Greatline's single cycle and software &amp; hardware multi cycle processor project. 

The semester long project consisted of designing and implementing from scratch a three processors; A single cycle processor, a software multicycle processor, and a hardware multicycle procesor, all of which were implemented using VHDL and tested using testbenches and QuestaSim waveform analysis.
